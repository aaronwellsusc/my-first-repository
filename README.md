### About

I live in Newport Beach, California and currently work in the RF Engineering industry. I have a very diverse background, and a curiousity about everything and how things work.  This has led me down many rabbit holes, and so far I'm satisfying that curiousity through continuing to learn about the industry and improve processes with software solutions.  


### Reading

Three of my favorite books are:

- *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F* by Mark Manson
- *The Alchemist* by Paul Coelho
- *Moral Letters to Lucilius* by Seneca

### Interests

I'm fascinated by all things tech and science-y:

1. Software - Bash scripts, C#, Python, Node, JS 
2. Hardware - Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Microcontrollers
3. Electronics - Simple circuits and making useless projects
4. Building - DIY, Experimenting and learning how materials are used to create electronics
